# Project Overview 

**Project Title:** Retail Sales Analysis

**Level:** Beginner

**Database:** retail_sales

This project aims to showcase fundamental SQL techniques commonly employed by data analysts to explore, clean, and analyze retail sales data. It involves designing and populating a relational database, conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and patterns, and leveraging SQL queries to address specific business questions and generate actionable insights.

# Objectives:
**1. Database Setup:** Design and initialize a retail sales database by importing and structuring the provided dataset to enable efficient querying and analysis.

**2. Data Cleaning:** Detect and address data quality issues by identifying and handling missing, null, or inconsistent values to ensure data reliability.

**3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conduct preliminary analysis using SQL to explore data distributions, uncover trends, and gain a foundational understanding of the dataset.

**4.Business Analysis:** Formulate and execute SQL queries to answer key business questions, enabling data-driven decision-making and extracting actionable insights.
# Project Structure:
**1. Database Setup**

      -**Database Creation:** The project starts by creating a database named retail_sales.
